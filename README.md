# PlatformerLuxe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Scanix/PlatformerLuxe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Scanix/PlatformerLuxe)

A little project that I start to teach myself how to use the [LuxeEngine](http://luxeengine.com/docs/). For the time the code is really messy, because I just want to try the functionalities.

For the moment there is some test on the "Platformer" physic, tilemap, sprite, camera and some others.

If I continue the project I'll try to clean-up the code and add some comments, maybe write one or two really quick guide on some functionalities, but there is already some guide on the official website of the engine [click here](http://luxeengine.com/docs/guide.html).

Feel free to reuse my code :smile:
