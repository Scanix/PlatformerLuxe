// The Simulation class handles two things:
//
//  - physics (simulation of gravity and forces)
//  - collision (separating colliding shapes from each other)
//
//   It is helpful to understand that these two concepts are distinct.
//   Often however, since the "response" from a collision overlap
//   will be fed directly back into the physics as a force,
//   it is easy to see them as one concept. Be aware of the difference :)

// - Collision = separating things that overlap)
// - Collision response = forces applied due to collision ("physics")
